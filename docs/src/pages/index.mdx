**JACDAC** (**J**oint **A**synchronous **C**ommunications; **D**evice **A**gnostic **C**ontrol) is a single wire broadcast protocol 
for the plug and play of microcontrollers (MCUs) within the contexts of rapid prototyping, 
making, and physical computing.

A JACDAC [bus](/clients/web/dom/bus) is made of connected devices.
A [device](/clients/web/dom/device) may host services.
A [service](/clients/web/dom/service) has registers, accept commands
and may return acks. A [register](/clients/web/dom/register) is an addressed data location, organized in [fields](/clients/web/dom/field), 
that may be get, set or streamed.

# Motivation

Widely used and highly efficient, I2C and SPI are the wired protocols of choice when connecting onboard sensors to microcontrollers. 
Since these protocols are supported as standard by many microcontrollers, they are also the defacto way of connecting external peripheral 
boards to microcontrollers. Wiring peripheral boards correctly is difficult for novice users and once wired, 
the configuration of the system is static and does not support plug and play.

With the wide-adoption of web technologies and the huge growth in the Internet of Things (IoT), 
the worlds of the feature rich and highly capable modern microcontroller and the Web should be closer together, yet they are not.

JACDAC is a dynamic plug and play serial protocol allowing the configuration of systems at runtime. 
It runs over a single wire allowing a variety of connectors to be used, 
simplifying connections between devices. Finally, WebUSB and TypeScript extends the JACDAC bus to the web browser (and the Internet), 
enabling the development of services and the debugging of the JACDAC bus directly from the Web browser, 
reducing the gap between the Web and the microcontroller.

# Specification

JACDAC operates in a bus topology and requires devices have a microcontroller with UART, Timer, and GPIO interrupt capabilities.

# Community

We are still in the process of setting up a community area for JACDAC discussions, 
but for now please feel free to file issues with questions [on the Github respository for this site](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac).

# Applications

## Fashion

JACDAC was the technology used to network microcontrollers together at the 
[BKLYN Fashion Academy](https://www.bklynlibrary.org/bklyn-fashion-academy) in 2019.
