# Jacdac

**Jacdac** is a plug-and-play hardware/software stack 
for **microcontrollers** and their peripherals (sensors/actuators), 
with applications to rapid prototyping, making, and physical computing. 

* novel 3-wire cable and connector
* bus topology
* device discovery and service advertisement
* standardized service abstraction
* full stack from 8bit MCU to web development

## Protocol overview

Jacdac devices communicate over a *bus*, where each *device* can advertise itself 
and the set of services it provides. 
A *service* encapsulates the process of communicating with a Jacdac device via packets.
A *packet* includes a device identifier and data payload. 
Jacdac packets are sent serially among physical devices on the Jacdac bus
and may also be sent over WebUSB, 
providing connectivity to web-based tooling and services running in the web browser
(see the connect icon at the top of this page).

## Services specifications

Jacdac services are specified to abstract the hardware device from the software implementation.
The services are comprised of registers, commands and events, along with precise data layout information
for each packet.

## Device catalog

The [device catalog](/devices) lists the registered Jacdac devices that can be automatically detected on the bus. 
The catalog information provides vendor information, the services supported by a device, firmware, and pictures. 
[Device entries](/reference/device-specification) are stored in the [Jacdac](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac) repository.

## Reference documentation

See the [overview of reference documentation](/reference/), including the Jacdac protocol specification.
