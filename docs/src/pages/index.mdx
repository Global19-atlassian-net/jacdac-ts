**JACDAC** (**J**oint **A**synchronous **C**ommunications; **D**evice **A**gnostic **C**ontrol) is a
a plug-and-play protocol for connecting microcontrollers and their peripherals (sensors/actuators)
within the contexts of rapid prototyping, making, and physical computing.

## Motivation

The advent of simpler programming environments for microcontrollers over the past decade has greatly 
changed who can write code for them. It is now possible for novices to program microcontrollers using only a 
web browser, a process that was previously the domain of skilled embedded firmware engineers. 
However, despite a marked improvement in software tooling, it’s still challenging to build devices 
that bring together new combinations of hardware, as traditional protocols (such as I2C and SPI) 
for connecting microcontrollers to each other and to peripherals (such as sensors and actuators) 
are low-level and inflexible. 

JACDAC is a new protocol for low-cost microcontrollers that makes connecting microcontrollers and peripherals 
as simple as plugging a USB device into your personal computer. JACDAC’s reversible physical connector, a flexible bus-based topology, 
standardized signalling and service specifications, hardware and software reference designs, and modern web-based tooling bring interactive 
device prototyping into the 21st century. The careful design of JACDAC means that it’s inexpensive and low power; it can be supported by 
microcontrollers that cost as little as two and a half US cents.  Support for WebUSB and TypeScript extends the JACDAC bus to the web 
browser (and the Internet), enabling the development of services and the debugging of the JACDAC bus directly from the Web browser, 
reducing the gap between the Web and the microcontroller.

## Specification

JACDAC operates in a bus topology and requires devices have a microcontroller with UART, Timer, and GPIO interrupt capabilities.

A JACDAC [bus](/clients/web/dom/bus) has a set of connected devices.
A [device](/clients/web/dom/device) may host services.
A [service](/clients/web/dom/service) has registers, accepts commands, and may return acks. 
A [register](/clients/web/dom/register) is an addressed data location, organized in [fields](/clients/web/dom/field), 
that may be get, set or streamed.

## Services

The [list of known service specifications](/services) provides a set of 
standaridized JACDAC modules. Additional modules can be specified in the [specification](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac) repository.

## Device Catalog

The JACDAC project contains a catalog of known devices that 
can be automatically detected on the bus. Once a device is detected, 
the catalog information provides vendor information, pictures and firmware information.

## Community

We are still in the process of setting up a community area for JACDAC discussions, 
but for now please feel free to file issues with questions [on the Github respository for this site](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac).

### Fashion

JACDAC was the technology used to network microcontrollers together at the 
[BKLYN Fashion Academy](https://www.bklynlibrary.org/bklyn-fashion-academy) in 2019.
