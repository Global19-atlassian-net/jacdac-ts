## Specification

**JACDAC** (**J**oint **A**synchronous **C**ommunications; **D**evice **A**gnostic **C**ontrol) is a single wire broadcast protocol 
for the plug and play of microcontrollers (MCUs) within the contexts of rapid prototyping, 
making, and physical computing.

JACDAC operates in a bus topology and requires devices have a microcontroller with UART, Timer, and GPIO interrupt capabilities.
